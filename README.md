This is a website that utilizes HTML structure, CSS stylesheet and JavaScript to present some JavaScript snippets that use the input of the user and provide a calculated output. 
For example we have areaperiphery.js which calculates the area or periphery of a circle, based on the preferences of the user, given the radius as user input. The other snippets follow this logic.
